He was afraid of the big trees, the dark shadows, and even the smallest noises.\n\nOne day, Pippin was playing in the meadow when he saw a group of older rabbits teasing a smaller rabbit. Pippin knew he had to do something to help. He took a deep breath and hopped over to the older rabbits. He stood up tall and told them to leave the smaller rabbit alone.\n\nThe older rabbits were surprised by Pippin's bravery, and they backed away. The little rabbit was so grateful to Pippin for saving him. He learned that even the smallest of us can be brave when we stand up for what is right.",

I was in my office and one of the junior executives came in and he told me that he admired me and gave me a blue ribbon for being creative genius. The blue ribbon that says \"Who I am makes a difference\".\n\nThen he gave me an extra ribbon and asked me to find somebody else special to honor. As I was driving home tonight, I started thinking about whom I would honor with this ribbon and I thought about you. My days are really hectic, and when I come home, I don't pay a lot of attention to you. Sometimes I scream at you for not getting enough good grades in school and for your bedroom being a mess.\n\nBut somehow tonight, I just wanted to sit here and, well, just let you know that you do make a difference to me. Beside your mother, you are the most important person in my life. You're a great kid and I love you.' The startled boy started to sob and sob, and he couldn't stop crying. His whole body shook. He looked up at his father and said, through his broken tears, 'I was planning on committing suicide tomorrow, Dad, because I didn't think you loved me. Now I don't need to do that.' Love cures people – both the ones who give it and the ones who receive it.",
